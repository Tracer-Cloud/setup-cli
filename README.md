## Overview

**Tracer** is a system-level observability platform purpose-built for scientific computing and workflow automation.  
This GitHub Action installs the Tracer CLI, enabling you to monitor, analyze, and optimize your pipelines directly within GitHub Actions workflows.

- **Monitor Nextflow, WDL, CWL, Bash, and Python pipelines in CI/CD**
- **Track execution time, cost, and bottlenecks per step**
- **Get instant dashboards for every workflow run**
- **Works out-of-the-box with GitHub-hosted runners**

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Tracer to Your GitHub Workflow

```yaml
- name: Install Tracer Client
  uses: Tracer-Cloud/setup-cli@v1
  with:
    tracer_user_id: ${{ secrets.TRACER_USER_ID }} # Optional
    cli_branch: main # Optional, defaults to main
    installer_branch: main # Optional, defaults to main
```

### 2. Monitor Your Pipeline

Add Tracer steps to your workflow to initialize and monitor your pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Initialize Tracer
  run: sudo tracer init

- name: Run your pipeline
  run: nextflow run main.nf # or your workflow command

- name: View Tracer Info
  run: tracer info
```

> **Tip:** All Tracer metrics and logs are available in your [Tracer dashboard](https://sandbox.tracer.cloud).

## Why Monitor Pipelines in GitHub Actions with Tracer?

- **End-to-end observability** for scientific and data pipelines
- **Real-time dashboards** for every workflow run
- **Step-level timing and cost analysis**
- **Works with any language or tool (Nextflow, WDL, CWL, Bash, Python, etc.)**
- **No code changes required**â€”just install and go!

---

## Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Monitor Pipeline with Tracer
on: [push, workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  tracer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Tracer Client
        uses: Tracer-Cloud/setup-cli@v1
        with:
          tracer_user_id: ${{ secrets.TRACER_USER_ID }}
      - name: Initialize Tracer
        run: sudo tracer init
      - name: Run Pipeline
        run: nextflow run main.nf
      - name: Tracer Info
        run: tracer info
```

## Try Tracer with Example Workflows

Looking for ready-to-use pipelines to test Tracer? Check out our curated set of example workflows:

ðŸ‘‰ [Nextflow & Bioinformatics Test Pipelines (GitHub Actions)](https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/nextflow-test-pipelines?tab=readme-ov-file)

These workflows demonstrate Tracer in action across Nextflow, WDL, CWL, and more. Fork or run them directly to see Tracer's observability in your own CI/CD environment!

---

## Security & Privacy

- Tracer runs locally in your workflow runner; your data never leaves your infrastructure unless you choose.
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance.

---

## Key Features

- **Monitor pipelines in GitHub Actions** (SEO: monitor pipelines, GitHub Actions, CI/CD observability)
- **Track time and cost per dataset**
- **Identify bottlenecks and optimize performance**
- **Works with Nextflow, WDL, CWL, Bash, Python, and more**
- **Seamless integration with cloud and on-prem environments**
